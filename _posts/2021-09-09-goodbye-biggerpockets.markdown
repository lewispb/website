For the past 2 years I've had the privilege of working alongside some truly excellent folks at
[BiggerPockets](https://www.biggerpockets.com). I'd like to specifically thank my manager,
[Edd Morgan](http://eddmorgan.com) for his support and encouragement throughout that time. I've learned a lot from him.
I'm also truly grateful to everyone else at BiggerPockets, past and present, for making my time there so enjoyable.

I joined in September 2019 with high hopes of working remotely, whilst occasionally travelling to Denver, CO, where
BiggerPockets HQ is located. Alas, the pandemic struck just a few months later and the focus was on us all getting
through those unprecedented times safely. We continued to work, to fix bugs, design and ship new products,
and grow the business.

I'm especially proud of the work the team and I did on:

- [Building BP Insights](https://www.biggerpockets.com/insights/property-searches/new)
- Migrating our email system to use [Iterable](https://iterable.com)
- A reliable CI/CD pipeline
- Coding conventions and [patterns](https://biggerpockets.github.io/patterns/)

My last day at BiggerPockets will be September 22nd 2021.

I genuinely feel sad to be leaving, and it wasn't an easy decision. However it's been a goal of mine for some time to
try something new. For me right now, that means working less on user facing features and a product team and more on
technical infrastructure and platform features.
