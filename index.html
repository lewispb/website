    <p>
      I'm a <strong>Ruby developer</strong> from the UK.
      I've been building web applications for the past 17 years. I love the web, and the <strong>freedom</strong> it brings.
      I'm passionate about building incredible products that users love to use.
      And I think that <a class="text-orange-600 hover:text-gray-700" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is the best platform with which to build those products.
