    Hi, I'm Lewis, and I'm a Ruby developer from the UK.
    I've been building web applications for the past 17 years. I love the web, and the freedom it brings.
    I'm passionate about building incredible products that users love to use.
    And I think that Ruby on Rails is the best platform that lets us build those products.
