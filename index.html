  <h1 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Lewis, and I'm a <strong>Ruby developer</strong> from the UK.
    I've been building web applications for the past 17 years. I love the web, and the <strong>freedom</strong> it brings.
    I'm passionate about building incredible products that users love to use.
    And I think that <a class="text-orange-600 hover:text-gray-700" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is the best platform that lets us build those products.
  </p>
