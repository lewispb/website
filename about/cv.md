# CV

Creative, passionate and friendly developer with a wide skill set, strong programming and design skills, backed by **9 years of experience** developing software professionally, **7 with Ruby**. Comfortable communicating with both technical and non-technical colleagues. I enjoy working in a multidisciplinary product team and especially working with a product owner to design a great user experience which is technically realistic.

I specialise in creating websites and web applications using:

  - Ruby on Rails, many associated libraries, and with tests
  - Relational databases (Postgres and MySQL)
  - Redis
  - Kafka
  - HTML, CSS, SASS, ERB, HAML and SLIM
  - Javascript (Turbolinks, Stimulus, Webpacker, React etc.)
  - Git, Github, Jira, Trello, Slack, Mac OS X
  - Product and design thinking, data analysis, experimentation
  - Iâ€™ve deployed (and maintained) applications and systems to AWS, Heroku, custom Linux servers running on Linode and used a variety of deployment tools including Capistrano.
